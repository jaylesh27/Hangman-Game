<!-- 
Pseudocode for Hangman:

1. Have computer pick a word from the set of words around the chosen theme
	-Display it as underscored blanks on the screen
	-theme will be national parks, change background to image of the national park after user wins/loses
2. User guesses a letter (have text on screen that says "Press any key to get started")
	-convert guessed letters to uppercase
	-if letter is part of word, display it on the screen as part of the underscored blanks that represent the word
	-don't change number of guesses remaining if correct letter is guessed
	-if not part of word, display letter on screen as part of a section that has guessed letters
	-reduce "number of guesses remaining" by one if incorrect letter is guessed
	-if user picks the same incorrect letter again, don't change "number of guesses remaining"
3. If user finishes the word before user runs out of guesses, increment "Wins" by 1
4. When user wins/loses, change screen/pic to match the word in the previous round and start a new round by changing to a new word
	-reset "number of guesses remaining"
	-clear "guessed letters" section
